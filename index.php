<!--Write an index.php script using HTML, SQL, PHP that retrieves data from the music-db database
that you have created under 1(b) via a graphical user interface using HTML forms.

Features to Include
It should allow a new user to register with a username and password.
The submitted username and password should be written to the users table of your music-db database.
If a user enters a username that is already taken, the user should be alerted to pick a different username. (Passwords do not need to be unique)
Upon entering a username, all songs that the user has rated, including the userâ€™s rating should be returned. Songs that the user did not rate should not be returned.
You do not need to populate the database with songs through an HTML form; you can assume it is already populated
