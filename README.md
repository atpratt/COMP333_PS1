Wilson:

3/1:
-Finished 1a markdown file to populate our music database with tables and implemented foreign keys that cascade on delete
-it all seems to work correctly
-Database in phpMyAdmin must be named "music-db"

3/2:
-Finished index.php file
-Have NOT run it to see if it works
-Still need to implement a stylesheet named "stylesheet.css" that index.php links to
